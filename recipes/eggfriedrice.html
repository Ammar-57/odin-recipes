        <h2>Egg-Fried-Rice Recipe:</h2>
        <p>Egg Fried Rice is among those popular choices when it comes to dining at a Chinese restaurant. It's the first thing I order because it always hits the spot!

            It's also great for dinner or lunch time if you have leftover cooked rice sitting in the fridge. With some leafy greens like bok choy and a fried egg on top to make it a complete meal. I'll be teaching you how to make this dish at home.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs.</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons peanut, vegetable, or olive oil.</li>
            <li>1 cup diced onion.</li>
            <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups diced mixed vegetables.</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sliced scallions.</li>
            <li>pinch of salt(optinally MSG).</li>
            <li>4 cups cooked overnight jasmine rice.</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce.</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder.</li>
            <li>dash of ground white pepper(optional).</li>
            <li>1 to 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a small bowl and beat them together.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet with 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the beaten eggs and scramble them for about a minute. Transfer the eggs to a dish and turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil into a wok over high heat. Add the onions and cook them for about 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the mixed vegetables and white parts of the scallions and cook for 2 minutes. Season the vegetables with a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked rice into the pan or wok and cook for several minutes, until the rice is heated through. If there are large clumps of rice, break them apart with the back of your spatula.</li>
            <li>Add the soy sauce, five-spice powder, dash of white pepper (if using) and sesame oil and stir to distribute the seasonings. (See note 6) Add the scrambled eggs and stir to mix again. Garnish with remaining sliced scallions. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
