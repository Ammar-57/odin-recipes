        <!--Keep your chin up-->
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups (325g) all purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups (414g) sugar</li>
            <li>3 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 cup (240ml) milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup (240ml) water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparing and Baking:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 190C, 375F, gas 5. Line two muffin trays with 12 cupcake cases or bake in batches of 12 using one muffin tray.</li>
            <li>Start by creaming butter and sugar(opens in new tab) together in a bowl using a wooden spoon or electric whisk. Beat until soft and fluffy. Then add the flour, eggs, milk, and salt and whisk until the mixture is smooth.</li>
            <li>Use a traditional-style ice-cream scoop, or spoon, to divide the mixture between all the paper cases making sure to get an even amount of mixture in each.</li>
            <li>Place both muffin tins in the oven and bake for 15 minutes, then swap over the position of the tins over and bake for a further 3-7 minutes, until both trays of cupcakes are a light golden colour.</li>
            <li>Remove the tins from the oven. Leave the cupcakes to cool in the tins for a few minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool. Once completely cooled, the cupcakes can be decorated.</li>
        </ol>
